# Project Name: **Java Swing-based Application**

## Project Description:
This is a Java-based desktop application developed using Swing for the user interface. The project integrates multiple features, including database interaction via SQL queries. The necessary dependencies and resources have been added in the GitHub repository, and this README will guide you through setting up the environment, installing necessary tools, and running the project in Eclipse.

## Prerequisites:

Before running the project, you will need to install and set up the following tools:

- **Eclipse IDE for Java Developers**:
  Download Eclipse IDE for Java Developers from the [official website](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
  
- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**:
  Make sure JDK 8 or later is installed. You can download it from [Oracle’s official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

- **MySQL or any SQL Database**:
  The project relies on a MySQL database, but any relational database should work with minor modifications. Install MySQL from [MySQL Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).

- **Git**:
  Install Git to clone the repository. You can download it from [Git Official Website](https://git-scm.com/).

---

## Setting up the Environment:

1. **Install Eclipse**:
   - Download and install Eclipse from the link provided in the prerequisites section.
   - Launch Eclipse and set up your workspace (a directory where you want to store your projects).

2. **Install JDK**:
   - Make sure JDK is installed and configured in your system. To verify, run `java -version` in the terminal to check if Java is properly installed.

3. **Install MySQL** (or your preferred relational database):
   - Install MySQL on your system if it's not already installed.
   - Set up the MySQL service and ensure it's running.

---

## Clone the Repository:

1. Open the terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store your project.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   ```
4. Navigate into the cloned project folder:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

---

## Importing the Project in Eclipse:

1. Open Eclipse IDE.
2. Click on **File** > **Import**.
3. In the Import Wizard, select **General** > **Existing Projects into Workspace**.
4. Click **Next**, then click **Browse** to select the folder where you cloned the project.
5. Once the project appears in the list, click **Finish**.

---

## Installing Dependencies:

### Adding External JARs:
The project relies on several JAR files for database interaction and Swing functionality. Here's how to add them in Eclipse:

1. Right-click on the project in the **Project Explorer**.
2. Select **Build Path** > **Configure Build Path**.
3. Under the **Libraries** tab, click **Add External JARs**.
4. Navigate to the folder where you have stored your JAR files (which are part of the repository), and select all required JARs (e.g., MySQL Connector, etc.).
5. Click **Apply and Close**.

---

## Database Setup:

The project requires a database to function correctly. Follow the steps below to set it up:

1. **Create a Database**:
   - Open your MySQL client or MySQL Workbench.
   - Run the SQL queries provided in the `database_creation_queries.sql` file to create the necessary tables and relationships.
   
   Example command:
   ```sql
   source path/to/database_creation_queries.sql;
   ```

2. **Database Configuration**:
   - The project uses JDBC to connect to the database. Open the project in Eclipse and locate the file where the database connection is established (usually in a `DatabaseManager` class or similar).
   - Modify the database connection details (username, password, and database URL) according to your MySQL setup.

   Example JDBC connection:
   ```java
   Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database", "root", "password");
   ```

---

## Running the Project:

1. **Ensure the MySQL service is running** (or the service for your chosen database).
2. Make sure all external jar files are properly referenced.Jar files used(itextpdf,my_sql_connection,fontbox,commons-logging,pdfbox)
3. In Eclipse, navigate to the main class where the application is launched (typically where `public static void main(String[] args)` is located).
4. Right-click on the class and select **Run As** > **Java Application**.

The application should now launch, and you will be able to interact with the user interface built using Java Swing.

---

## Additional Notes:

- **IDE Debugging**: You can debug the application by setting breakpoints in Eclipse and using the **Debug** option.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure all JAR files are added to the build path if they are missing or if new libraries are added.
- **Error Handling**: If you encounter any issues related to database connectivity, check your database username, password, and URL, as well as ensure the database service is running.
