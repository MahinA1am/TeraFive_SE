# Travel and Tour Management Database  

Welcome to the **Travel and Tour Management Database** repository! This project provides a comprehensive database solution to manage operations for travel agencies or tour management systems. The SQL file in this repository defines the database schema, relationships, and initial data setup.  

## Features  

This database supports:  
- **Customer Management:** Manage customer profiles, including contact information and preferences.  
- **Travel Packages:** Store details of travel packages, destinations, activities, and pricing.  
- **Bookings and Reservations:** Track customer bookings and reservation statuses.  
- **Payment Records:** Log payment details for completed and pending transactions.  
- **Travel Agents:** Manage information about travel agents and their assigned responsibilities.  

## File Overview  

- **`travel_and_tour_management.sql`**  
  - Contains SQL scripts to:  
    - Create all database tables, relationships, and constraints.  
    - Insert sample data for testing and initial setup.  
    - Define keys and relationships for efficient queries.  

## How to Use  

1. **Set Up the Database:**  
   - Open your database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).  
   - Import the SQL file using the following command:  
     ```sql  
     SOURCE /path/to/travel_and_tour_management.sql;  
     ```  

2. **Explore the Schema:**  
   - Use your DBMS tools to view tables, relationships, and data.  

3. **Run Queries:**  
   - Experiment with queries to retrieve, insert, or update data based on your needs.  

## Example Queries  

Here are some examples to get started:  

- Retrieve all available travel packages:  
  ```sql  
  SELECT * FROM travel_packages;  
  ```  

- Find bookings for a specific customer:  
  ```sql  
  SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE customer_id = '12345';  
  ```  

- View payment records for completed bookings:  
  ```sql  
  SELECT * FROM payments WHERE status = 'Completed';  
  ```  

## Prerequisites
