# Inventory Management System

## Description

This project is a database schema and sample dataset for an **Inventory Management System**, created using MySQL/MariaDB. It provides a structure for managing inventory items, categories, and related data, allowing developers to build or extend inventory solutions effectively.

## Features

- **Database Tables**:
  - `category`: Stores inventory categories.
  - Additional tables may include product details, user accounts, and transactions.
- **Data Included**:
  - Sample categories such as "Food," "Electronics," and "Fabric."
- Designed to support applications for inventory tracking and management.

## Prerequisites

- MySQL or MariaDB installed.
- Access to a tool like phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or the MySQL CLI for database management.

## Installation

1. Open your MySQL client or database management tool.
2. Create a new database named `inventory_management` (or your preferred name):
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE inventory_management;
   ```
3. Import the SQL file into the database:
   ```bash
   mysql -u [username] -p inventory_management < Inventory Management System.sql
   ```
4. Verify the imported tables and data.

## Usage

- Extend the schema to add more functionality such as inventory tracking, user authentication, or reporting.
