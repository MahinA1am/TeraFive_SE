Table Structures and Their Purposes

1. `book_details`
   - **Purpose**: Stores booking information including user details, package ID, hotel ID, price, and dates.
   - **Key Columns**:
     - `User_name`: Name of the user making the booking.
     - `P_ID` and `H_ID`: References to the package and hotel associated with the booking.
     - `Total_Price`: Total cost of the booking.
     - `Arrival_Date` & `Leaving_Date`: Dates for the booking.

2. `hotels`
   - **Purpose**: Stores information about available hotels.
   - **Key Columns**:
     - `H_ID`: Unique identifier for each hotel.
     - `Location`, `H_Name`, and `H_Price`: Details about the hotel, including pricing.
     - `Rating`: Hotel's average rating.

3. `packages`
   - **Purpose**: Stores information about travel packages.
   - **Key Columns**:
     - `P_ID`: Unique identifier for each package.
     - `P_Price`, `P_Name`, and `Description`: Details about the package.

4. `users`
   - **Purpose**: Stores information about users of the system.
   - **Key Columns**:
     - `id`: Unique identifier for each user.
     - `email`: Unique email for user login.
     - `password`: Stores user password (should ideally be hashed for security).

Data Relationships
    Foreign Keys:
  - `book_details.P_ID` references `packages.P_ID`.
  - `book_details.H_ID` references `hotels.H_ID`.

These relationships ensure data integrity between bookings, packages, and hotels.



Indexes
Indexes are added to optimize query performance:
- Primary keys (`id`, `P_ID`, `H_ID`).
- Unique constraint on `users.email`.
